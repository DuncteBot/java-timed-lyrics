[VERSION]: https://img.shields.io/maven-metadata/v?metadataUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmaven.lavalink.dev%2Freleases%2Fme%2Fduncte123%2Fjava-lyrics-plugin%2Fmaven-metadata.xml

# Lyrics.java
A very simple lyrics client based on YouTube and [Lyrics.Kt](https://github.com/DRSchlaubi/lyrics.kt)

## Differences from Lyrics.kt
The biggest difference between this version and the kotlin version is the filesize.
At the time of writing, lyrics.kt plugin is about `696 KiB` in size, while this plugin is about `34 KiB` in size. A massive reduction.

The second difference is the search endpoint. 
Instead of putting the query into the path of the url, this plugin opted to use query parameters for it.
Making the endpoint more restfull.

# Feature overview
- Small plugin size
- Lyrics from YouTube
- Uses IP-rotation
- Automatically get lyrics based on the currently playing track
- Timestamped lyrics so you can highlight the current line.
- Optional support for genius lyrics if none are found on YouTube.
- Support for [LavaLyrics](https://github.com/topi314/LavaLyrics) (see the end of the readme)

## Using in your clients
This plugin comes with a protocol library that allows you to use jackson for deserialization of the JSON.
You can include the library as follows with gradle:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven("https://jitpack.io")
}

dependencies {
    implementation(group = "com.github.DuncteBot.java-timed-lyrics", name = "protocol", version = "x.y.x")
}
```

replace x.y.x with this version: [![](https://jitpack.io/v/DuncteBot/java-timed-lyrics.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#DuncteBot/java-timed-lyrics)
